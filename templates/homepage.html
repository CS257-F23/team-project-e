    <h1> Welcome to our World Bank Financial Data Website!</h1>
    <h2> There are 3 functionalities for this app.</h2> 
    <p> You can either retrieve:</p>
    <ul>
        <li>A summary of four interesting statistics about a country</li>
        <li>A comparison between the percentage of country that has a financial account to the worldwide statistic</li>
        <li>A comparison between the average age of a country and the percentage of the population that is worried about financing their education</li>

    statistics across multiple countries globally, we provide invaluable data for researchers, professors, and students alike.</p>
