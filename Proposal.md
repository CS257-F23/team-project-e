**Interesting/meaningful ways that a user could interact with the data:**



1. Using the website as an interactive resource to draft players for a fantasy premier league. 
2. It can be an interactive dashboard for football fans to quickly view interesting statistics.
3. Users can sort/rank players based on stats like goals, assists, etc.

**Team Contract:**



1. **What are the goals of our team?**
    a. We would like to create an aesthetic and functional website that returns top players in the premier league over the past five years. We can also explore using previous game performance for different players to predict the outcome of their next game. This could have applications with a fantasy futbol team. 
2. **What are the strengths of our team and its members?**
    a. Maddy is organized and writes good comments in the code.
    b. Albert has domain knowledge in football, which will meaningfully help us better understand the variables in the dataset.
    c. Helana is good at taking notes.
    d. Colin is able to work well in groups. Has knowledge of basic AI and ML techniques.
3. **How will we capitalize on the strengths of each member?**
    a. We will all talk about our agenda at the beginning of each meeting. As we work through the meeting, we will regularly revisit what we need to get done and change assignments/roles to make sure we are on target.
4. **What are the rules that will guide your team?**
    a. We will tentatively work as a full group. We will split up goals and responsibilities if needed if that will be more effective or efficient.
    b. Tentative rotating roles: developer/documentation and tester/organizer
    c. Work will be divided evenly.
    d. We will meet in Anderson/Olin in the evenings. The days and times will depend on what we communicate in our group chat about.
    e. To make sure communication stays respectful, we will be sure to use polite language with each other. If someone is confused, we will make time to explain things to them so they don’t feel left behind.
    f. On that note, we will use a group chat to communicate with each other and make sure everyone is participating.
    g. If a team member is failing to be communicative, we will check in with them in class and make sure everything is ok.
    h. We hope all decisions can be unanimous, but if they can’t be, then we will decide by majority vote. 
    i. We will aim to meet in person as often as possible. If we can’t all be together, we can use FaceTime or Zoom.
    j. We will make sure everyone’s contribution is valued by listening to everyone respectfully and giving them time to form their ideas and opinions.
    k. As long as everyone sticks to their deliverables on time and is contributing to group ideas and discussions, we will say that participation is satisfactory.
    l. If conflict arises within the team, we will always try to sort it out respectfully amongst ourselves first. If that doesn’t make things better, we can set up a team meeting to talk to Anya about strategies for resolution.
