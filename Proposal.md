**Interesting/meaningful ways that a user could interact with the data:**


1. The website can act as an interactive dashboard to get world wide statistics involving economic and household data. 
2. The user can make targeted comparisons between interesting or seemingly related variables.
3. The user can draw conclusions about global variations in economic and household status through country comparisons.

**Current team roles:**
* Albert and Maddy will be writing and testing the function that gets the percentage of internet access by country.
* Helana and Coling will be writing and testing the function that compares education with gender by country.

**Team Contract:**


1. **What are the goals of our team?**
    * We would like to create an aesthetic and functional website that returns world wide economic and household data. This could have applications toward educational and research purposes, especially for papers and comparative studies between countries economies.
2. **What are the strengths of our team and its members?**
    * Maddy is organized and writes good comments in the code.
    * Albert has worked with datasets of this nature before, and also has experience with SQL.
    * Helana is good at taking notes.
    * Colin is able to work well in groups. Has knowledge of basic AI and ML techniques.
3. **How will we capitalize on the strengths of each member?**
    * We will all talk about our agenda at the beginning of each meeting. As we work through the meeting, we will regularly revisit what we need to get done and change assignments/roles to make sure we are on target.
4. **What are the rules that will guide your team?**
    * We will tentatively work as a full group. We will split up goals and responsibilities if needed if that will be more effective or efficient.
    * We will have two tentative rotating roles, developer/documentation and tester/organizer.
    * Work will be divided evenly.
    * We will meet in Anderson/Olin in the evenings. The days and times will depend on what we communicate in our group chat about.
    * To make sure communication stays respectful, we will be sure to use polite language with each other. If someone is confused, we will make time to explain things to them so they don’t feel left behind.
    * On that note, we will use a group chat to communicate with each other and make sure everyone is participating.
    * If a team member is failing to be communicative, we will check in with them in class and make sure everything is ok.
    * We hope all decisions can be unanimous, but if they can’t be, then we will decide by majority vote. 
    * We will aim to meet in person as often as possible. If we can’t all be together, we can use FaceTime or Zoom.
    * We will make sure everyone’s contribution is valued by listening to everyone respectfully and giving them time to form their ideas and opinions.
    * As long as everyone sticks to their deliverables on time and is contributing to group ideas and discussions, we will say that participation is satisfactory.
    * If conflict arises within the team, we will always try to sort it out respectfully amongst ourselves first. If that doesn’t make things better, we can set up a team meeting to talk to Anya about strategies for resolution.
